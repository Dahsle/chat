I've always been interested in P2P, I learned the basics of HTML CSS and some JS and learned almost everything related to it, but for me it's hard, I'm not an engineer this is my hobby.
There are programmers with great professionalism and big hearts on Github, especially those who write programs under a free license, there are 19,402 public repositories, and if each of you contributed and wrote at least one line of code, this would be the open source application of my dreams...
