I've always been interested in P2P, please contribute, I've learned the basics of HTML CCS and a bit of JS and have learned almost everything related to it, but it's difficult for me, I'm not an engineer. There are programmers with great professionalism and big hearts on Github, especially those who write programs under a free license, there are 19,402 public repositories, and if each of you wrote even one line of code, this would be the open source application of my dreams . . . .
